Before you started, you need to guarantee that youâ€™ve already installed `python3` and `pip3`.

## Steps to use

### Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/BiEchi/ZJU_PunchClock
```

### Install the dependencies on your python

```shell
pip3 install selenium
pip3 install time
pip3 install configparser
```

### Config your identical information

You need to create a file in the root directory of this repository called `config.ini` with your personal information in it.

```shell
touch config.ini
```

Then please go into the file and edit it to be in this form:

```shell
[identification_information]
account_config=Haob.88@intl.zju.edu.cn
password_config=FAKEDPASSWD
```

### Install the `chromedriver`

**Install the Chrome driver**

You also need to install `chromedriver` into your system `PATH`.

**Before started**

Before you install the chromedriver, you should have:

![before started](./images/readme_about/before_started.png)

Then you need to install the `chromedriver`. 

**Check for the right version of Chrome**

Please open the current Chrome (if you have) and check which version you're in. For example, mine is 94.0.4606.

![check for right version](./images/readme_about/check_for_right_version.png)

 **Download the correct version of chromedriver**

Go to [the download website](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) to download the correct version of ChromeDriver. If you're using Windows, make sure you download the Windows version. I'm using Mac, so I'll download the Mac version.

![correct version](./images/readme_about/correct_version.png)After downloading, please unzip the file and move it to your system PATH.

![move into PATH](./images/readme_about/move_into_path.png)

Then please check whether you've successfully installed your chromedriver. If you see the feedback below, you're all set.

Notes:

\-   You must download exactly the same version of `chromedriver` as your chrome browser if you want to use the `chromedriver` as your selenium driver. The chrome browser on your machine is likely to be updated automatically when a new version is released. In this case, please update to the newest version of `chromedriver` too.

\-   I strongly recommend you to install the `chromedriver` into the system software directory immediately, i.e. it should appear in `/usr/local/bin/chromedriver`.

### Run the program

At last, just run the `main.py` program.

```shell
python3 main.py
```
